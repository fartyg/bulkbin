To search for multiple cards at the same time separate using space + comma, like so:
12345, 12345, 12345, 12345</p>

<p>bincodes.com limits requests to 20 per day unless you pay a small amount. Requires API key.

binlist.net has a limit to amount of requests per day but does not require an API key.
