You can enter only the 6 digit BIN code or a full card number.
In the case of entering a cardnumber, it will only keep the first 6 digits.

To search for multiple cards at the same time separate using comma+space, like so:
12345, 12345, 12345, 12345

bincodes.com requires API key that you can get for free. Requests limited to 20 per day.
binlist.net requires no API key but limits requests per day.

  To get full use out of this script one should consider 
  paying a small fee for unlimited access from one of the above BIN database website.
  
  This script can easily be adapted to fit the API of other BIN APIs.
