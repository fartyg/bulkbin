<h2>Bank identification numbers in bulk - No more captcha codes!</h2>

This is my very first useful thing made in Python.
The purpose has been to learn while solving a real world problem.

You can enter only the 6 digit BIN code or a full card number.
In the case of entering a cardnumber, it will only keep the first 6 digits.

To search for multiple cards at the same time separate using comma+space, like so:
12345, 12345, 12345, 12345 
Duplicate BINs will be removed.

bincodes.com requires API key that you can get for free. Requests limited to 20 per day.
binlist.net requires no API key but limits requests per day.

    To get full use out of this script one should consider 
    paying a small fee for unlimited access from one of the above BIN database website.
  
    This script can easily be adapted to fit the API of other BIN websites.

To exit the program, press 'ctrl+c'
