# bulkbin
<pre><h1>Search card BIN information in bulk</h1>

Do not enter captcha codes for every BIN search - do it in bulk!

You can enter only the 6 digit BIN code or a full card number.
In the case of entering a cardnumber, it will only keep the first 6 digits.

To search for multiple cards at the same time separate using space + comma, like so:
12345, 12345, 12345, 12345

bincodes.com limits requests to 20 per day unless you pay a small amount. Requires API key.
binlist.net has a limit to amount of requests per day but does not require an API key.

To get full use out of this script one should consider getting 
unlimited access from one of the above BIN database websites.
