<h2>Bank Identification Numbers in Bulk - No more captcha codes!</h2>

This is my very first useful thing made in Python.
The purpose has been to learn while solving a real world problem.

You can enter only the 6 digit BIN code or a full card number.
It will only keep the first 6 digits of each set of numbers entered.

To search for multiple BINs at the same time separate using comma+space, like so:
12345, 12345, 12345, 12345
or
12345,  12345,    12345, 12345 (amount of spaces should not matter)
or
12345,12345,12345 (no spaces)

Duplicate BINs will be removed.

- bincodes.com requires API key that you can get for free. Requests limited to 20 per day.
- binlist.net requires no API key but limits requests per day. Use this version to quickly test.

    To get full use out of this script one should consider paying a small fee 
    for unlimited access from one of the above BIN database website.
  
    This script can easily be adapted to fit the API of other BIN databases.
    If you have opinions on which BIN database is best/most up to date, let me know.


To exit the program, press 'ctrl+c'
